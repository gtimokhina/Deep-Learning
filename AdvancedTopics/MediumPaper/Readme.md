Based on the paper: “Generative Adversarial Networks in Digital Pathology: A Survey on Trends and Future Potential”
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14936.pdf

In this research paper, authors summarized current GAN-based architectures 
applied to histological image data exploration. Lately, deep learning 
methods and mostly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) where recognized 
as very powerful and general tools that capable to perform  a large variety of tasks.

There are several applications specific to digital pathology: 
stain normalization, stain adaptation, segmentation based on supervised
learning , the synthesis of image data based on segmentation masks  and data augmentation as
translation settings. 
All these applications are basically mapping/transaltion from one input domain to another output domain. 
There are three such mappings recognized: 
Latent to-Image (Z2I), Image-to-Image (I2I) and Image-to-Label (I2L) translation.

Each of the pathology task is assigned to one of this mapping/translation and 
specific GAN-based architectures described and analyzed for solving the task.
At the same time, authors describe challenges and potential improvements using 
current GAN-based architectures. 

Overall, methods relying on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) demonstrate 
the potential to decrease the necessity of large amounts of manual annotations. 
There is optimism that this technology will play an important role in real-world 
applicability in digital pathology image analysis.
